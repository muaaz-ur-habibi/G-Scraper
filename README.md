<h2 align="center"><center>A GUI based web scraper, written wholly in Python</center></h2>

<h3>What❓:</h3>
<p>
  A fun little side project that I made.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Why❓:</h3>
<p>I was looking through Reddit for fun project ideas and came across a thread in which there was a comment of someone complaining about there not being a GUI Web Scraper. Thus I started working on G-Scraper.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Features ✨:</h3>(✅means that it is implemented. ❌means that i am working on it.)
<br>
<ol>
  <li>✅ Supports 2 request types; GET & POST (at the moment)</li>
  <li>✅ Shows all your added info in a list</li>
  <li>✅ Can scrape multiple URLs</li>
  <li>✅ Can scrape multiple elements from the same URL (webpage)</li>
  <li>✅ So putting the two together, can scrape multiple elements from multiple URLs, ensuring that the element is from the URL it was assigned to</li>
  <li>✅ Can pass request parameters into the request to send for scrape</li>
  <li>✅ Since parameters can be passed, it can also handle logins/signups</li>
  <li>✅ Saves the scraped data in a seperate 'data/scraped-data' folder</li>
  <li>Has a logging function: logs 3 types of outputs<ul>
    <li>✅ Elemental (for elements)</li>
    <li>✅ Pagical   (for webpages)</li>
    <li>✅ Error     (for errors)</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Handles all types of errors</li>
  <li>✅ Request function runs in a seperate thread than GUI so you can do things while your request is being run</li>
  <li>❌ Functionality to edit the variables once they have been added</li>
  <li>❌ Can delete an unwanted item from the list of added variables</li>
  <li>✅ Can reset the entire app to start brand new after a scrape/set of scrapes</li>
  <li>❌ Provides verbose output to user in the GUI (this is very hard)</li>
  <li>❌ User can set 'presets', basically if user does a scrape repetitively they can set a preset. User can then just load and run the preset without having to define the variables each time</li>
  <li>✅ Unique way for generating unique filename for each log AND save data file so that no mixups happen</li>
</ol>
